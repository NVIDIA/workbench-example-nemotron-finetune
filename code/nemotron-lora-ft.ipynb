    "# Fine-Tuning Nemotron-3 using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\n",
    "Nemotron-3 is a robust, powerful family of Large Language Models that can provide compelling responses on a wide range of tasks. While the 8B parameter base model serves as a strong baseline for multiple downstream tasks, they can lack in domain-specific knowledge or proprietary or otherwise sensitive information. Fine-tuning is often used as a means to update a model for a specific task or tasks to better respond to domain-specific prompts. This notebook walks through downloading the Nemotron-3 8B model from Hugging Face, preparing a dataset, and using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the base model against the dataset using NVIDIA NeMo Framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, feel free to play with our own Nemotron-3 8B Model fine-tuned to this QA task [here](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/nemo-8b-qa). By the end of this workflow, you will see how we were able to achieve such results fine-tuning the base model to Extractive QA data and create your own version of it!\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of LoRA is based on the paper, [LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=nZeVKeeFYf9) by Hu et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Preparation\n",
    "The model needs to be downloaded prior to being fine-tuned. The following blocks walk through this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading the model\n",
    "First, the 8B-base variant of Nemotron-3 needs to be downloaded to your machine. To download the model, follow the instructions [here](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-3-8b-base-4k) to accept the NVIDIA AI Foundation Models Community License Agreement for access to the models in the Nemotron family. Please note that your Hugging Face account email address MUST match the email you provide on NVIDIA's developer site, or your request will not be approved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once approved, use your Hugging Face username and API key to download Nemotron-3 7B (non-chat version) to your workstation where you will be fine-tuning the model. To pull the model files to your local machine, you may navigate on your local machine to the folder you specified as the mount for ```/project/models``` and use a ```git lfs clone https://huggingface.co/<namespace>/<repo-name>``` call to [NVIDIA's HF repository](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-3-8b-base-4k/tree/main). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the repository cloned locally, you can double check that the model is in the correct location if you can see ```/models/nemotron-3-8b-base-4k``` show up on the left hand side panel of this jupyterlab. Ensure the ```.nemo``` file for the model is present inside the directory."

    "## Preparing The Dataset\n",
    "We will be using LoRA to teach our model to do Extractive Question Answering. The dataset being used for fine-tuning needs to be converted to a .jsonl file and follow a specific format. In general, question and answer datasets are easiest to work with by providing context (if applicable), a question, and the expected answer, though different downstream tasks work as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading the dataset\n",
    "We will be using the [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowd workers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text. More information on [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) can be found on their website or in their paper by Rajpurkar et. al \"[Know What You Donâ€™t Know: Unanswerable Questions for SQuAD](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03822.pdf)\"."

The `input` field should contain all the tokens necessary for the model to generate the `output`.

    "Note that we use keywords in the input like `Context:`, `Question:` to separate the text representing the context and question. We also use the keyword `User:` and end each of the input with `\\n\\nAssistant:` tokens.
